    <string name="about_text">PATHS explores and tackles misconceptions and common stereotypes about homelessness in Seattle. This project builds empathy with the homeless community using
    visual, interactive stories based on real events and issues that have been anonymized. By offering different perspectives in the lives and struggles of homeless individuals, or those who
    work closely with the homeless, PATHS guides users into other people\'s shoes. With empathy, people are better equipped to advocate, donate, and engage with this systematic issue.</string>
